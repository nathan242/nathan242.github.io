<h1>PHP ICAP Client</h1>
<p>Project repo: <a href='https://github.com/nathan242/php-icap-client'>LINK</a></p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>PHP client library for the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (RFC 3507).</p>
<p>This library allows PHP to interact with ICAP servers (such as virus scanners and content filters). It supports building an ICAP request with a request body containing encapsulated parts of another request (such as HTTP) and can parse the body of an ICAP response according to the &quot;Encapsulated&quot; header into a PHP array.</p>
<p>I originally wrote this so a PHP microservice responsible for storing uploaded files could run them through a virus scanner and I was unable to find a PHP implementation of an ICAP client.</p>
<p>The library currently does not support message preview functionality or persistent connections (each request will close the connection at the end) but I may add support for those at a later time.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>The library can be installed via composer:</p>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
composer require nathan242/php-icap-client
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Instantiate the class with the ICAP server address and port:</p>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
$icap = new IcapClient('127.0.0.1', 13440);
</pre>
</div>

<p>Send an OPTIONS request to the "example" service:</p>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
$icap->options('example');
</pre>
</div>

<p>Send a REQMOD and RESPMOD request to the "example" service:</p>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
$icap->reqmod(
    'example',
    [
        'req-hdr' => "POST /test HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\n",
        'req-body' => 'This is another test.'
    ]
);

$icap->respmod(
    'example',
    [
        'res-hdr' => "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nServer: Test/0.0.1\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n",
        'res-body' => 'This is a test.'
    ]
);
</pre>
</div>

<p>Successful requests will return an array describing the response:</p>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
Array
(
    [protocol] => Array
        (
            [icap] => ICAP/1.0

            [Encapsulated] => res-hdr=0, res-body=64
            [Server] => ICAP/1.3 Python/2.7.3
        )
