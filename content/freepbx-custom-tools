<h1>FreePBX Custom Tools</h1>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>My custom FreePBX management tools. I created these to help me with running a FreePBX based phone system.</p>
<p>To use the tools, place the files in a subfolder under your FreePBX web server root.</p>


<h4>Features</h4>
<p><strong>TFTP Manager</strong><br>
This allows you to generate config files for Cisco 7940 IP phones. The code assumes that the TFTP root is at "/tftpboot" and this folder needs to be writeable to the web server in order to function correctly.<br>
It will display a table showing the configured extension for each MAC address. You can simply reassign a phone to a different extension by selecting a new one from the dropdown in the table or create a new one by specifing the new MAC at the top.</p>

<p><strong>Extension List</strong><br>
This is a simple extension list viewer with the ability to export into CSV. You can easily customize the format of the CSV in the code.</p>

<p><strong>Extension Config</strong><br>
This will list the ring groups and queues that each extension is a member of. This is useful if you have a large number of extensions and want to get an overview of who is in what.</p>

<p><strong>Inbound Routes</strong><br>
This will visually show the routes taken by inbound phone numbers. I created this to make it easier to verify the configuration of a FreePBX server as it is cumbersome to manually follow all the routes through the normal UI.<br>
This is an example of what it will output:</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Database settings are set in each file in the database class instantiation. You will need to check that they are set correctly.</p>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
$db = new mdb(&lt;host&gt;, &lt;user&gt;, &lt;password&gt;, &lt;database&gt;);
</pre>
</div>

<p>You can change the TFTP root path used by the TFTP manager by setting it in the "cnfManager" class instantiation.</p>
<div class='code'>
<pre>
$cnf = new cnfManager($db, '/tftpboot');
</pre>
</div>

<p>Just change the string "/tftpboot" to the correct path.</p>
