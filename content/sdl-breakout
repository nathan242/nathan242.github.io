<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Breakout game I created using C++ and SDL2. It is based on the physics and graphics code used in <a href='SDL-Pong.html'>SDL-Pong</a>.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>Use the arrow keys to move your paddle left and right or press Q to quit. You have 3 lives and a life is lost when the ball falls off the bottom of the screen. Destroy all the blocks to advance to the next level. There are 3 levels and completing the final one will continue to the first one again.</p>

<h4>Todo</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Add a score counter to show number of blocks destroyed.</li>
</ul>
