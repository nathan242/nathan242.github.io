<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Breakout game I created using C++ and SDL. It is based on the physics and graphics code used in <a href='SDL-Pong.html'>SDL-Pong</a>.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>Use the arrow keys to move your paddle left and right or press Q to quit. Currently there is no concept of lives and the game will still continue once all the blocks have been destroyed. I hope to implement those features when I get time.</p>

<h4>Todo</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Add support for lives with game over logic.</li>
  <li>Add a score counter to show number of blocks destroyed.</li>
  <li>Add a game complete screen when all blocks have been destroyed.</li>
</ul>
