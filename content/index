<p>Welcome to my Github projects site!</p>
<p>This site is about my Github projects and other things that I decide to write about.<br>
Most of my Github projects were either created for learning or started as a quick solution to a problem.<p>

<h4>A few things about me</h4>
<p>I am a self taught sysadmin and programmer. The main programing languages I use are <strong>C/C++</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>. My favourite editor is ViM and my prefered OS is Debian GNU/Linux. My MBTI is INTJ, also known as the mastermind or the architect.<p>

<h4>About this site</h4>
<p>This site is built using my build script: <a href="build-site.py">build-site.py</a><br>
The script builds the static pages using the content defined in the "/content/" directory.</p>
